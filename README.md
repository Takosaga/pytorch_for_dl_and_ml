# Learning PyTorch for Deep Learning and Machine Learning

Learning from this [24 hour long](https://youtu.be/V_xro1bcAuA?si=ogWofhL5y0hBiG32) youtube course and using the accompanying [website](https://www.learnpytorch.io/) 

## 00 Fundamentals
Learned:
* pytorch is similar to numpy and pandas
* manipulating tensors dtype and shape
* indexing tensors
* interoperability with numpy
* reproducibility with seeds
* moving tensor and pytorch objects on cpu and gpu
* running objects on gpu and some amd cards lack floating point operations
